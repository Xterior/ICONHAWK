# ICONHAWK
ICONHAWK monitors any transaction that occurs on selected public address you've chosen. 

It is an alternative towards 'fiddeling' around with your phones and papers; making the transaction faster, smoother and more professional. It is especially useful for merchants for accepting payments by using this software.

Disclaimer: This software is still early alpha and may have some bugs in them. If you find any please report them to: icxhawk@gmail.com

TODO: 

- Ability to configurate so that you can make your own design and share it with others with a file (Very time consuming)
- Refactor code by a lot
