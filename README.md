# ICONHAWK
ICONHAWK monitors any transaction that occurs on selected public address you've chosen. 

It is an alternative towards 'fiddeling' around with your phones making the transaction faster, smoother and more professional. It is especially useful for merchants to accept payments by using this software instead of their phones. 

The application only accepts a public address so it is impossible to get ahold of anyones funds through this software only. 

Important contributors: 

- Spl3n for awesome technical help
- 2infinity (Check out his A-Z guide for developing on ICON https://medium.com/@2infiniti/creating-icon-dapp-from-a-z-part-1-tools-environment-dd56f8dfc905 )

Disclaimer: This software is still early alpha so it does include some flaws so to speak. It has also only been tested on Mac so if you have any issues on any other operating system HMU!

TODO: 

- Add logo above QR-Code.
- Reorganize code.
- add a pop-up window every time a new payment occurs for small period of time.
- Fix the payments so that the latest payment is always at the top instead of bottom.
