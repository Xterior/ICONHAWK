It is an alternative towards 'fiddeling' around with your phones making the transaction faster, smoother and more professional. It is especially useful for merchants to accept payments by using this software instead of their phones. 

The application only accepts a public address so it is impossible to get ahold of anyones funds through this software only. 

Disclaimer: This software is still early alpha so it does include some flaws so to speak.
