# ICONHAWK
ICONHAWK monitors any transaction that occurs on selected public address you've chosen. 

It is an alternative towards 'fiddeling' around with your phones and papers; making the transaction faster, smoother and more professional. It is especially useful for merchants for accepting payments by using this software.

Disclaimer: This software is still early alpha (and requires development knowledge to run for now) it also include some flaws so to speak. It has also only been tested on Mac so if you have any issues on any other operating system HMU!


TODO: 

- Ability to configurate so that you can make your own design and share it with others with a file (Very time consuming)
- Refactor code by a lot
